# Getting Started
## <span style="color:#B59111"> Pre-Requisite </span>
* These packages assume you will use Behavior Designer Pro, and are designed with it in mind. You can still use the UIToolkit packages, by deleting the Scenes/ and Scripts/ with the 'BP-' Prefix.
* These projects were made in Unity 6.0, However I know they work from 2022 and onward at least.
* You can buy (or check) if you have BDPro from the Unity Asset Store Link here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/behavior-designer-pro-dots-powered-behavior-trees-298743

# FAQ:
### <span style="color:#A469A4">I have missing prefabs in my scene, how do I fix this? </span>
* * These are prefab variants from the Unity Asset Store Character Controller. Once you install the *Starter Assets Character Controller* (_link included above_), it should auto resolve when you reload the scene.

### <span style="color:#A469A4">I am getting a handful of script errors when I open the scene. </span>
* * Many of the scripts reference the Included Packages. Install the [IncludedPackages](#Included-Packages) from the package manager and they should self-resolve.
